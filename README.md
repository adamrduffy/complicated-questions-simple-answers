## How to detect a loop in a linked list?

Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm, also know as tortoise and hare algorithm.

The idea is to have two references to the list and move them at different speeds. Move one forward by 1 node and the other by 2 nodes.

```java
boolean hasLoop(Node first) {

    if(first == null) // list does not exist..so no loop either.
        return false;

    Node slow, fast; // create two references.

    slow = fast = first; // make both refer to the start of the list.

    while(true) {

        slow = slow.next;          // 1 hop.

        if(fast.next != null)
            fast = fast.next.next; // 2 hops.
        else
            return false;          // next node null => no loop.

        if(slow == null || fast == null) // if either hits null..no loop.
            return false;

        if(slow == fast) // if the two ever meet...we must have a loop.
            return true;
    }
}
```

## Fibonacci Algorithm

### Recursion

```java
public int fibonacci(int n)  {
    if(n == 0)
        return 0;
    else if(n == 1)
      return 1;
   else
      return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

### Iteration

```java
int Fibonacci(int n)
{
   int f1 = 0;
   int f2 = 1;
   int fn;
   for ( int i = 2; i < n; i++ )
   {
      fn = f1 + f2;
      f1 = f2;
      f2 = fn;
   }
} 
```

## Identical Balls Problem

Question: You are given 8 identical looking balls. One of them is heavier than the rest of the 7 (all the others weigh exactly the same). You a provided with a simple mechanical balance and you are restricted to only 2 uses. Find the heavier ball.

Answer: For convenience sake, letâ€™s name the balls 1-8. First we weigh {1,2,3} on the left and {4,5,6} on the right. There are three scenarios which can arise from this.

If the left side is heavier, then we know that one of 1, 2 or 3 is the heavier ball. Weigh {1} on the left and {2} on the right. By doing this, we will know if 1 or 2 is heavier. If they balance out, then 3 is the heavier one.

If the right side is heavier, then we know that either 4, 5 or 6 is the heavier ball. Weigh {4} on the left and {5} on the right. By doing this we will know if 4 or 5 is heavier. If they balance out, then 6 is the heavier one.

If {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} balance out, then we know either 7 or 8 is the heavier one. Weigh both of them to find out which one is heavier.

# REST

## PUT vs POST
Better is to choose between PUT and POST based on idempotence of the action.

PUT implies putting a resource - completely replacing whatever is available at the given URL with a different thing. By definition, a PUT is idempotent. Do it as many times as you like, and the result is the same. x=5 is idempotent. You can PUT a resource whether it previously exists, or not (eg, to Create, or to Update)!

POST updates a resource, adds a subsidiary resource, or causes a change. A POST is not idempotent, in the way that x++ is not idempotent.

# Java

## Inheritance vs Composition

Inheritance is an "is-a" relationship. Composition is a "has-a".
You do composition by having an instance of another class C as a field of your class, instead of extending C.

## Method Overloading vs Method Overriding

Method overloading deals with the notion of having two or more methods in the same class with the same name but different arguments.

```java
void foo(int a)
void foo(int a, float b)
```

Method overriding means having two methods with the same arguments, but different implementations. One of them would exist in the parent class, while another will be in the derived, or child class. 

You can't override the static method because they are the part of class not object. You can override the overloaded method.

http://stackoverflow.com/a/12374437

## Abstract vs Inteface

A class that is declared as abstract is known as abstract class. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

Interface is a blueprint of a class that have static constants and abstract methods. It can be used to achieve fully abstraction and multiple inheritance.

## Covariant Return Type

What this means is that a method in a subclass may return an object whose type is a subclass of the type returned by the method with the same signature in the superclass. This feature removes the need for excessive type checking and casting.

http://stackoverflow.com/a/10134596

## Runtime Polymorphism

In static polymorphism, compiler itself determines which method should call. Method overloading is an example of static polymorphism.

In runtime polymorphism, compiler cannot determine the method at compile time. Method overriding(as your example) is an example of runtime polymorphism. Because in Runtime polymorphism (as your example), the signature of methodA() is similar in both the class X(base class) and Y(child class). So compiler cannot determine method at compile time which should execute. Only after object creation(which is a run time process), the runtime environment understand the exact method to call.

## What are the differences between a HashMap and a Hashtable in Java?

There are several differences between HashMap and Hashtable in Java:

Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not. This makes HashMap better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones.

Hashtable does not allow null keys or values.  HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values.

One of HashMap's subclasses is LinkedHashMap, so in the event that you'd want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), you could easily swap out the HashMap for a LinkedHashMap. This wouldn't be as easy if you were using Hashtable.

## What is the difference between the Set and List interfaces?

List is an ordered sequence of elements whereas Set is a distinct list of elements which is unordered.

List

An ordered collection (also known as a sequence). The user of this interface has precise control over where in the list each element is inserted. The user can access elements by their integer index (position in the list), and search for elements in the list.

Set

A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at most one null element. As implied by its name, this interface models the mathematical set abstraction.

## What are the similarities and difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Both implement the Java List interface.
ArrayList is implemented using resizable arrays. LinkedList is implemented using a doubly linked list.

For bonus points ask if they know the Big O for each:
ArrayList is O(1) for get, typically O(1) for addition but could be O(n) if the array has to be resized, O(n) for deletion.
LinkedList is O(n) for get, O(1) for addition and O(n) for deletion.

## What are the similarities and difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
Both implement the Java Map interface. Both do not support duplicate keys.
TreeMap is used when the entries need to be sorted. HashMap when ordering is not important.
HashMap uses hashCode method on the key to find the location of the value.
TreeMap uses red-black tree, i.e. a self-balancing binary search tree.

For bonus points ask if they know the Big O for each:
HashMap is O(1) for get, TreeMap is O(log n) for get.

## What are the keys differences between Comparable and Comparator.

When your class implements Comparable, the compareTo method of the class is defining the "natural" ordering of that object. That method is contractually obligated (though not demanded) to be in line with other methods on that object, such as a 0 should always be returned for objects when the .equals() comparisons return true.

A Comparator is its own definition of how to compare two objects, and can be used to compare objects in a way that might not align with the natural ordering.

For example, Strings are generally compared alphabetically. Thus the "a".compareTo("b") would use alphabetical comparisons. If you wanted to compare Strings on length, you would need to write a custom comparator.

In short, there isn't much difference. They are both ends to similar means. In general implement comparable for natural order, (natural order definition is obviously open to interpretation), and write a comparator for other sorting or comparison needs.

## What does 'synchronized' mean?

When you have two threads that are reading and writing to the same 'resource', say a variable named foo, you need to ensure that these threads access the variable in an atomic way. Without the synchronized keyword, your thread 1 may not see the change thread 2 made to foo, or worse, it may only be half changed. This would not be what you logically expect.

### Double-checked locking

If you need to use lazy initialization for performance on an instance field, use the double-check idiom. This idiom avoids the cost of locking when accessing the field after it has been initialized (Item 67). The idea behind the idiom is to check the value of the field twice (hence the name double-check): once without locking, and then, if the field appears to be uninitialized, a second time with locking. Only if the second check indicates that the field is uninitialized does the call initialize the field. Because there is no locking if the field is already initialized, it is critical that the field be declared volatile (Item 66).

## How to declare a constant in Java?

You can use an enum type in Java 5 and onwards.

Use the final modifier on a field in a class or declare a field in an interface.

### What are enums and why are they useful?
You should always use enums when a variable (especially a method parameter) can only take one out of a small set of possible values. Examples would be things like type constants (contract status: "permanent", "temp", "apprentice"), or flags ("execute now", "defer execution").

If you use enums instead of integers (or String codes), you increase compile-time checking and avoid errors from passing in invalid constants, and you document which values are legal to use.

http://stackoverflow.com/a/4709224

## What is static block

It's a static initializer. It's executed when the class is loaded (or initialized, to be precise, but you usually don't notice the difference).

It can be thought of as a "class constructor".

http://stackoverflow.com/a/2943575

## What does Serializable mean?

Serialization is persisting an object from memory to a sequence of bits, for instance for saving onto the disk. Deserialization is the opposite - reading data from the disk to hydrate/create an object.

http://stackoverflow.com/a/3429939

## When would you use the transient keyword?
Transient modifier tells the Java object serialization to exclude the field when serializing an instance of the class

## When would you use the volatile keyword?
"...the volatile modifier guarantees that any thread that reads a field will see the most recently written value." - Josh Bloch

When multiple threads using the same variable, each thread will have its own copy of the local cache for that variable.

So, when itâ€™s updating the value, it is actually updated in the local cache not in the main variable memory. The other thread which is using the same variable doesnâ€™t know anything about the values changed by the another thread.

To avoid this problem, if you declare a variable as volatile, then it will not be stored in the local cache. Whenever thread are updating the values, it is updated to the main memory. So, other threads can access the updated value.

# Tiles

Tiles allows authors to define page fragments which can be assembled into a complete page at runtime. These fragments, or tiles, can be used as simple includes in order to reduce the duplication of common page elements or embedded within other tiles to develop a series of reusable templates. These templates streamline the development of a consistent look and feel across an entire application.

Declared in tile definition file where each definition may have one or more attributes.
